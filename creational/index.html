      <h1>Prototype/Class Pattern</h1>
      <p>
        Allows us to define a blueprint for a specific type of item and then reuse it by creating a new object from that class. 
        Alternative: specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
        and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object,
        thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.
      </p>

  <section id="constructor">
      <h1>Constructor/Builder Pattern</h1>
      <p>
        The constructor pattern is one step further from the class pattern, 
        where we leverage a class created to initiate a new extended class from it. 
        Alternative: Object constructors are used to create specific types of objects â€” 
        both preparing the object for use and accepting arguments which a constructor can use to set the values of member properties
        and methods when the object is first created..
